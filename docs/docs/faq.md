# Frequently Asked Questions


### **Troubleshooting when no Cassandra process is started**

  The Cassandra-Mesos framework first allocates executors for all seed nodes. It starts the Cassandra processes after the initially configured number of seed nodes have been allocated.

  _Example:_ If you have configured 3 seed nodes, but only 2 executors are allocated, no Cassandra process
  is started. After the 3rd executor is allocated, all Cassandra processes are started in the normal fashion.


### **Can I run Cassandra in the cloud?**

Yes! However, if you run Mesos on Amazon EC2 or Google Compute Engine, make sure that all Cassandra nodes live in one availability zone for now. Cross region deployments are currently unsupported.


### **Cassandra processes have started but it takes a long time until the whole cluster is running**

  Here are the defined Cassandra-Mesos
  limitations before a Cassandra process can be started:

  1. A minimum of one Cassandra seed node must be running and in operation-mode `NORMAL`.
     Otherwise, other nodes cannot join the cluster.
  1. All other nodes must be in operation-mode `NORMAL`.
  1. Only a single Cassandra processes can be started within the configuration parameter `bootstrapGraceTimeSeconds`.
     This allows a previously started node to successfully bootstrap.

### **Are multi-homed servers supported?**

  Yes, if you configure Apache Mesos and Apache Cassandra correctly.

  **Security risk notice:**
  If you have an interface that faces the public internet and you expose ports that are used by Apache Mesos and/or Apache Cassandra to the public internet, you are at serious risk of compromise. **Never expose ports to the public internet and configure your firewall rules carefully!**

  **Special note on JMX port** Sun/Oracle do not
  bind the JMX network listener to a specific IP and/or interface, which means that JMX is available on all
  interfaces.

### **JMX port of Apache Cassandra**

  A possible security risk in Apache has been closed in versions 2.0.14 and 2.1.4. This had impact to the
  current development of the Cassandra-Mesos framework. Since 2.0.14 and 2.1.4 Apache Cassandra only opens the JMX port (usually 7199) on the loopback address (`127.0.0.1`). If you wish to open it **and know that you introduce a possible security risk**, you can pass the environment variables CASSANDRA_JMX_LOCAL=false` and `CASSANDRA_JMX_NO_AUTHENTICATION=true` to the framework upon **initial** invocation (i.e. when the framework first registers).

  [CASSANDRA-9089](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-9089) is meant to let JMX listen to a
  specific IP address, but is is not included in Cassandra 2.1.4.

### **Which versions of Apache Cassandra are supported?**

  All Apache Cassandra versions from 2.1 forward work with this version of the Cassandra-Mesos framework.
  **Note** Currently there is no official mechanism to upgrade from one version to another.

### **Cassandra nodetool complains with strange exceptions**

  The  `nodetool` and  `com-nodetool` are not designed to be executed against releases outside of the ones they are taken from. This means that a `nodetool` command from 2.1.2 issued against 2.0.14 may not work. There is no guaranteed compatibility in JMX between versions of Apache Cassandra.
